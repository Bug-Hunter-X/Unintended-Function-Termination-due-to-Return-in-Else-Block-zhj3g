This repository showcases a common error in ActionScript programming: unintended function termination due to a return statement placed within an else block.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides the corrected version. The issue arises because the return statement in the else block halts execution of the function, preventing subsequent code from running, even if it should logically be executed regardless of the condition. The solution demonstrates how to restructure the code to ensure all intended operations are carried out. This example highlights the importance of careful code structuring and placement of return statements to prevent unexpected behavior.
